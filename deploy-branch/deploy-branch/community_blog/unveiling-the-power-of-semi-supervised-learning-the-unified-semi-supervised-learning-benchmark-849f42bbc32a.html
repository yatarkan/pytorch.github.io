<p>Machine Learning models thrive on high-quality, fully-annotated data. The traditional supervised learning approach typically requires data on the scale of millions, or even billions, to train large foundational models. However, obtaining such a vast amount of labeled data is often tedious and labor-intensive. As an alternative, semi-supervised learning (SSL) aims to enhance model generalization with only a fraction of labeled data, complemented by a considerable amount of unlabeled data. This blog introduces USB â€” the Unified Semi-Supervised Learning Framework and Benchmark, covering multi-modalities and various SSL scenarios.</p>
